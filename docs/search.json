Whilst captured error metrics (e.g. R, visual assessment can assess timing issues related seasonal peaks.Transects : model results assessed terms seasonal mean along length domain (longitudinal transect). transect analysis allows system wide scale assessment conditions, smooths noise local variability field model predictions.Advanced measures : model results finally assessed considered partitioning nutrients terms inorganic vs organic, expected measures.Confidence : Based assessment evaluate confidence model assigning variable following categories:GoodAcceptable, andCaution.confidence evaluation, considers:Quality observed data, influenced field laboratory data limitations, methodologies, processes protocols.Error metric scores relative typically reported literature water quality models (e.g., Arhonditsis Brett, 2004).Ability CSIEM capture mean indicator spatial gradient seasonality.Partitioning water quality constituents within different ecosystem pools.Natural variability indicator different temporal scales (.e. sub-daily seasonal).","code":""},{"path":"integrated-assessment.html","id":"assessment-and-validation-periods","chapter":"5 Integrated Assessment","heading":"5.2 Assessment and validation periods","text":"Historical period: 1970-2010: initial assessment prior availability WAMSI research project data;Recent period: 2010-2020: initial assessment prior availability WAMSI research project data;Focus period: 2021-2022: initial calibrated intensive field sampling observations obtained different components WAMSI research project;Long-term performance: 2017 – 2022: calibrated long-term water quality data collected routine measurements, well WAMSI research project. results summarised .","code":""},{"path":"integrated-assessment.html","id":"integrated-simulation-performance","chapter":"5 Integrated Assessment","heading":"5.3 Integrated simulation performance","text":"integrated simulation performance provided Appendix B pending updated CSIEM modelling progress.","code":""},{"path":"references.html","id":"references","chapter":"References","heading":"References","text":"","code":""},{"path":"appendix-a-data-catalogue.html","id":"appendix-a-data-catalogue","chapter":"Appendix A : Data Catalogue","heading":"Appendix A : Data Catalogue","text":"","code":""},{"path":"appendix-a-data-catalogue.html","id":"cockburn-data-catalogue","chapter":"Appendix A : Data Catalogue","heading":"Cockburn data catalogue","text":"CSIEM data-set accessible via csiem-data GitHub repository.
